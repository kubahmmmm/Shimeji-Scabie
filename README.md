## 🐛 What is this?
This is a fun and chaotic Shimeji project featuring *Swierzbowce* (mites) that crawl around your screen, troll you, and sometimes… build rockets? 🚀

The Swierzbowce can:  
- Walk on your screen, walls, and ceiling 🐾  
- Clone themselves into groups of 4 and fly around 🚀  
- Transform into Minecraft skins or crazy animations 🤯  
- Build rockets, arm cannons, and release green-yellow dust 🌌  
- Cause chaos with a 0.1% chance of **crashing your PC** with over 100 Swierzbowce (good luck).
